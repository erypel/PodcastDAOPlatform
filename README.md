This is a rewrite of my JavaWebApp project in Node.js. This rewrite is happening because the Rippled API is not as supported for Java as I had hoped. I believe it will be quicker to do a rewrite in Node.js than trying to work a Java project into something that can easily and securely use the Rippled API which will power the DAO portion of the project. This will also allow for faster development of the DAO since the Node.js version of the API is a lot more powerful than using websockets.
